Description: This package provides functions to perform analysis of variance when the experimental units are spatially correlated. There are two methods to deal with spatial dependence: Autoregressive models and geostatistics. For both methods, there is three multicomparison procedure available: Tukey, multivariate T, and Scott-Knott.
